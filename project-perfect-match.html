                    <p>
                        "Perfect Match" is a project created for IAT 313 - Narrative and New Media, 
                        where we developed an ad campaign promoting a dating app that focuses on 
                        establishing serious connections between people. Our team aimed to integrate 
                        our original story into an advertisement, social media ads, a mobile app, 
                        and posters that effectively target our intended audience.

                    <h3>Idea</h3>
                    <p>
                        The foundation of our campaign was the original story "The Distance Between Us," 
                        which follows two characters, Monica and Jack, on their journey to find their soulmates. 
                        We wanted to explore the idea that these soulmates are leading parallel lives, separated by a 
                        myriad of obstacles, and how our dating app could help bridge the gap between them.

                    <h3>Initial Filming</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the film director of this project, my design process commenced with a deep exploration of how to effectively portray the two characters' longing for each other. Given their strikingly similar lives and the concept of being the "perfect match," I conceived the idea of employing a split-screen technique.
                        <br><br>
                        To create a sense of visual harmony, I meticulously captured both subjects in similar angles while they went about their respective activities. By doing so, I ensured a continuous engagement of the viewers' attention, smoothly shifting their focus from one character to the other. The juxtaposition of their parallel lives on the split screen enhanced the storytelling, magnifying the emotional depth of their connection and the longing they felt for each other.
                        <br><br>
                        Throughout the design process, my vision was to craft a visually captivating narrative that would resonate with our audience on a profound level. The split-screen concept became the cornerstone of our ad campaign, emphasizing the core essence of the dating app – connecting individuals with similar interests and life paths.

                        As for the climactic moment for the video's conclusion, the split-screen gradually darkened, it transitioned into a full-screen focus on the male character's (Jack) camera. The screen was expanded to fully immerse viewers in their encounter, and as well as to symbolize the pivotal moment of their union. 
                        <br><br>
                        Initially separated by the invisible wall between each characters, in a mesmerizing and unexpected turn, the female character (Monica) enters Jack's frame. Side by side, they walked away from the camera, embarking on a journey together.

                    <h3>Feedback</h3>
                    <p>
                        After receiving valuable feedback during our draft presentation, we realized that our initial split-screen concept fell short of effectively conveying the intended asynchronous vs. synchronous nature. We also identified unimportant clips that hindered character development and risked losing our audience's attention. To address these concerns, we made significant changes to our campaign.
                        <br><br>
                        We decided to overhaul the project by reshooting and re-storyboarding, condensing the video from two minutes to a more engaging 90 seconds. In place of split-screen editing, we opted for quick cuts to create seamless transitions between the two characters. The aim was to deliberately confuse the viewers about which character they were witnessing, highlighting the striking similarity in their lives.
                        <br><br>
                        To ensure a heightened focus on each scene, I directed the film to be presented in full screen. Additionally, we elevated the production quality by shooting the advertisement with a proper DSLR camera, maximizing image quality and depth of field with few exceptions in moving scenes, which was shot with GoPro Hero10 camera to fully utilize its image-stabilization technology. This upgrade lent a professional touch to the visuals, enhancing the overall cinematic experience.
                        <br><br>
                        Collaborating with Shallyn, our talented storyboarder, we strategically positioned the camera in unique angles to bring forth a fresh perspective to the scenes. This dynamic approach aimed to captivate the audience, allowing them to immerse themselves fully in the characters' intertwined lives.
                        <br><br>
                        By embracing these changes, we succeeded in transforming our ad campaign into a visually compelling and emotionally resonant piece. The seamless transitions, sharper visuals, and unique angles all contributed to a more impactful representation of the app's core message.

                        In the revised version, rather than having the two characters meet each other online and build a connection, we decided to highlight their parallel lives without them ever crossing paths until the very end.
                        <br><br>
                        In the climactic moment, Monica catches a fleeting glimpse of Jack, but the two characters continue on with their days, blissfully unaware of the potential connection they could have made. This powerful ending delivered a clear message – if users don't utilize our dating app, they risk missing out on their perfect match, just like Monica and Jack.
                        <br><br>
                        By introducing this new storyline, we evoked a sense of urgency and curiosity among viewers, igniting their desire to explore the possibilities our app could offer. This fresh approach underscored the app's potential to bring together kindred souls, leaving the audience pondering the potential missed opportunities.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout our journey, we encountered a myriad of challenges that put our creative prowess to the test. One of the most significant hurdles we faced was striking the delicate balance between preserving the essence of our narrative while simultaneously ensuring the ad's overall engagement and effectiveness. It was essential to maintain the heartfelt connection between our characters and their longing for each other while captivating our audience with a compelling and memorable campaign. This process demanded meticulous attention to detail, constantly revisiting our storyline, and fine-tuning our creative choices.
                    <br><br>
                    Adaptability emerged as another vital lesson we learned. As we presented our initial draft, we eagerly embraced feedback from peers and mentors. This feedback proved invaluable, highlighting areas where improvements could be made. With unwavering commitment to excellence, we recognized the need to be responsive to feedback and swiftly act upon it. 
                    <br><br>
                    As we navigated these challenges and embraced the process of growth, our journey became a testament to the power of resilience and dedication. We emerged not only with a compelling ad campaign but also with a sense of accomplishment, knowing that we had pushed the boundaries of our creativity and crafted something truly special.

                <h3>What we would do differently</h3>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on our journey, there are several key aspects we would approach differently if given the opportunity for this project again.
                    <br><br>
                    First and foremost, we would invest more time and effort into thoroughly understanding the core essence of our narrative and the unique elements that make it compelling. This deeper understanding would enable us to strike a harmonious balance between the story's essence and the ad's engagement, resulting in a more captivating and resonant campaign.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, we would prioritize iterative feedback loops and user testing throughout the creative process. This would allow us to gather insights and perspectives from potential users early on, giving us a better understanding of how our campaign resonates with the target audience. By incorporating user feedback in real-time, we could make informed decisions and ensure our ad aligns more closely with our audience's desires and expectations.
                    <br><br>
                    To optimize the production quality, we would allocate sufficient time and resources for reshooting and refining specific scenes, making use of advanced camera equipment and technology. This would enable us to capture even more visually striking and emotive moments, further enhancing the ad's impact on the audience.
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of teamwork, we would strengthen communication channels, ensuring all team members are actively engaged in the decision-making process. Regular check-ins and brainstorming sessions would foster collaboration and idea-sharing, maximizing the wealth of expertise and creativity within our team.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, we would approach the creation of marketing materials with a keen eye for visual consistency and branding. Ensuring that all elements, from posters to billboards, align with the central theme and style of the ad campaign would establish a strong and memorable brand presence in the minds of our audience.
